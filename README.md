Welcome to the Quiz App! This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. The app presents multiple-choice questions, each with four options. Once you answer all the questions, it calculates your score and displays it on the screen. If you want to take the quiz again, simply click the reset button to start over. This project demonstrates the use of React.js for creating interactive user interfaces. Have fun coding and quizzing!
